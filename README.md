# WebAccess

We developed this application to provide developers with a learning portal to familiarize themselves with web accessibility standards. There is a lot of content on the web, but it requires reading through a number of resources and it's time consuming. We wanted to make it easier to learn the important aspects of accessibility using flashcards, quizzes and easy-to-use resources. 

Our application was developed using React, a MongoDb database, Underscore, MDB React styling, Axios, NodeJS, Express server, and MomentJS-React. We also added some high level Jest and Enzyme testing.
